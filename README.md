# DESCRIPTION:

This Java program performs essential file-handling tasks, including reading, writing, and modifying text files. The program allows users to read the content of a specified file, displaying its text line by line on the console. It also enables users to create new files or overwrite existing ones by writing custom text input into the file. Additionally, the program supports modifying file content by applying transformations, such as converting text to uppercase or appending extra information, and saving the updated content back to the file or into a new file. With robust exception handling, the program gracefully manages errors such as invalid file paths or insufficient permissions, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience. This utility serves as a practical introduction to file-handling operations in Java, offering a solid foundation for understanding and implementing basic I/O concepts.
